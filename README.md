FullStack JavaScript Techdegree Project 9 - REST API

In this project I will be creating a REST API using express. This will provide a way to administer a school database containing information about users and courses. 

Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve info on existing courses and update or delete existing courses. 

To make changes to the database, it will be requires to log in so the API will allow users to create a new account or retrieve info on an existing account.
